I am a passionate AI Researcher who develops and applies different algorithms to solve real-world problems. I am currently working as an AI Researcher at ALI (Artificial Language Intelligence) Seoul, where I am focused on developing new AI technologies for open-domain knowledge services, including chat-bots and QA systems.

I have a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence from Kyungpook National University, where I worked on developing algorithms for natural language processing. I also worked on computer vision projects.

I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual with a strong work ethic. I am also a team player and enjoy working with others to achieve common goals.

I am excited to use my skills and experience to make a positive impact on the world through AI.

- 😄 &nbsp; Learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
- 👾 &nbsp; By far, the greatest danger of Artificial Intelligence is that people conclude too early that they understand it.
